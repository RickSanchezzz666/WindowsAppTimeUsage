## Stack

In this project, I have used ```C++ Qt Framework```. ```13.0.0 Qt Creator using Qt 6.7.0```.
Tested on ```Windows 10 x64```.

## About Application

The main idea of the project is to track the time spent in various Windows apps. 
Additionally, information about the start or close time of different apps, the last session time, the current session time, 
and the total time spent will be automatically updated in the ```timeUsageLogs.csv``` file.
